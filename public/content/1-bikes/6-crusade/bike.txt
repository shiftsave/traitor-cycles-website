Description: 

The Crusade is our race specific cyclocross frameset designed to be a competitive bike for all levels of racing. The new Crusade is disc only so you can save your rims from getting destroyed every season. Our new custom forged stainless steel dropouts allow you to run a geared setup or singlespeed with a QR for ultra quick wheel changes.

With our new system you set your tension one time and you can do wheel changes without ever having to retention it again. The dropouts come standard with the derailleur hanger or if you want a super clean singlespeed dropout without the hanger we have those available as well. The toptube has internal routing so no cables to get in the way of shouldering your bike. The downtube features bolt on removable cable stops for front and rear derailleur for barrel adjustment if you run gears. Finally the frame is coated with an ED finish that makes it rust proof inside and out of the frame and fork. If you are addicted to cross racing like we are you know how much fun a steel cross bike can be and the new Crusade is our approach to making a no compromise racer.


##### Features

1. Pure cyclocross race geometry designed specifically for demanding cyclocross courses. 
2. 4130 Lightweight Race Butted Seamless Chromoly tubeset and fork that absorbs rough cross course and creates a smoother ride. 
3. Custom Traitor Swinging Dropout system that allows the rider to run singlespeed or gears. Dropout comes with a internal chain tensioner to align the wheel and tension. This dropout system allows singlespeed riders to change a rear wheel without having to re-tension the wheel. 
4. Internal rear brake cable routing on the toptube so there are no cables in the way of shouldering your bike when you need to carry it over an obstacle. The internal routing has a full tube on the inside of the toptube so it is completely sealed so no water or mud can get inside the frame. 
5. 44mm oversized headtube so the rider has the ability to run a tapered carbon fork and steer tube. 
6. Removeable cable stops on the downtube for running gears or keeping a super clean look if you run singlespeed. 
7. Custom Traitor Segmented Fork with unique segmented fork crown usually only found on high end custom bikes. 
8. Legendary Traitor Copper Metal Headbadge.
