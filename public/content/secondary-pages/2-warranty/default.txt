Title: Warranty

----

Text: 

All Traitor Cycle frames and forks are warrantied for 2 years from the date of purchase. If you buy a complete bike from us and your Shimano rear derailleur has a problem you would deal directly with Shimano for any warranty service. 

The Traitor Cycles warranty applies specifically to a manufacturing defect that is caused by a flaw in materials or workmanship at the time the product was made. The warranty does not cover normal wear and tear of the product, the product being used outside the scope of the intended design or abuse from crashing or modifying the product. All potential warranty product must be sent to Traitor Cycles for evaluation to determine whether a warranty replacement is necessary. This warranty is only available for the original owner with proof of purchase and it is highly recommended you register your frame online with us. 

A Lifetime Crash Replacement policy is available for all Traitor Products. If for some reason you damage your Traitor Product due to a crash or unforeseen accident, Traitor Cycles will replace the product at a wholesale cost. Again, this policy applies only to original owners of the bike or frame.
